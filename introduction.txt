Hi, I'm learning Git and GitHub!
This is my first time making changes to a forked repository.
Today's date: 2024-01-24

What I've learned so far:
- How to fork a repository
- How to clone repositories
- How to make changes to files
- Learning about commits and pushes

This is a test change to verify Git is working!

- Second Change: Testing Git commands
- Third Change: Fixing Git errors

STATUS:
=======
Working on resolving Git push issues
Making sure changes are tracked properly
Testing commit and push functionality

FORK UPDATE:
===========

Now making changes to test the connection
